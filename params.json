{"name":"Code Auto-Complete Plug-in for Gedit 3","tagline":"Allows user to complete their code by pressing the TAB key.","body":"The Code Auto-Complete Plug-in will allow the user to complete their code with ease and allow faster development.\r\n\r\nParts of this plugin are based on the work of [Guillaume Chazarain](http://guichaz.free.fr/gedit-completion) and [Elias Holzer](http://elias.hiex.at/gedit-plugins/)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nThe plugin requires `exuberant-ctags` to be installed on the system.\r\n\r\nTo install [Exuberant Ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/) on Ubuntu, use the following command:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tsudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags\r\n\r\nThe plug-in was developed and tested for *Gedit 3.10.4*\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n- Download the files on your computer\r\n\r\n- Copy the files `auto-complete.plugin`, `auto-complete.py` and `helper.py` in the following folder:\r\n\r\n\t\t\t~/.local/share/gedit/plugins/\r\n\t\t\t\r\n  `~/` denotes your home folder. The `.local` folder is hidden by default. \r\n  You can unhide it by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd>. The folder `gedit` may not \r\n  be present by default, so, you may have to create it.\r\n\r\n- Enable the plug-in from the gedit menu: ***Edit -> Preferences -> Plugins***\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThis plug-in allows you to use auto completion like you're used to it in any unix console. Write the first few characters of a word you've already written in your text and hit <kbd>Tab</kbd>. If there are more possibilities hit <kbd>Tab</kbd> more times to go through the results.\r\n \r\nPress <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to iterate backwards in the case you you've gone too far.\r\n \r\nIf you cycled through a few words, found the one you were looking for and want to write a tabulator, hit a key like <kbd>Shift</kbd> or <kbd>Alt</kbd> and <kbd>Tab</kbd> afterwards.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Languages Supported\r\n\r\nThis plug-in current supports the following languages:\r\n\r\n- C\r\n- Python\r\n- Ruby\r\n\r\nSupport for more languages will be added soon along with other auto-completion features.\r\n\r\nIf there are any issues, please let me know.","google":"UA-62783789-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
